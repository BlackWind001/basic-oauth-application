# About this project
This is a project for me learn more about OAuth in depth instead of just being
a consumer.

## Requirements to run this project
1. Enable Google Drive in your Google Cloud console
2. The credentials file (cred.json) which will contain the client id and client secret of this app (obviously this will not be committed). This needs to be downloaded from Google Cloud Console.
3. You will most likely have to add the expected user as a test user on the console.

## Expected output
Just a log of your Drive files.
